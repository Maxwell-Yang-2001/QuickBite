# Designs

This directory contains design docs of this system.
Earlier versions are kept for keeping track of progress, but the newest version is always linked here.

Last version of SQL ERD:
![ERD](sql_early_design2.png)
This will no longer be updated.

## Stage 2: NoSQL
During the discussion, we found the limitation of SQL for couple partitions, including menu and orderline. So we decide to design the database base on NoSQL approach.
